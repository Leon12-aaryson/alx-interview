## Primegame

#### Concepts Needed:
##### Prime Numbers:

##### Understanding what prime numbers are.
Efficient algorithms for identifying prime numbers within a range.
##### Sieve of Eratosthenes:

An efficient algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to any given limit, which can be particularly useful for this task.
##### Game Theory:

Basic principles of competitive games where players take turns and the concept of optimal play.
Understanding win conditions and strategies that lead to a win or loss.
##### Dynamic Programming/Memoization:

Using previous results to make future calculations faster, potentially necessary for optimizing the solution for multiple rounds of the game.
##### Python Programming:

Loops and conditional statements for implementing game logic and algorithms.
Arrays and lists for storing the integers and tracking removed numbers.
